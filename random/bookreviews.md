snippet: "Short reviews for some of the books I've read."

---

The local public library uses the bibliocommons platform. I've started adding
short reviews for each of the books I've read. You can see most of them them at
the bottom of the [book list](booklist.md).

The titles are
"[author(s)] - [series (if any)] - [book name] - [finished timestamp] - [score/5]".
DNF == Did Not Finish.

## Greg Egan - Zendegi - 5/5 {#zendegi}
Disclosure: I was born and raised in Iran. I liked the book and especially the
parts related to Shahnameh. Not all the Farsi/Persian words used in the book
(mostly in conversations) were translated. I think non-native speakers would
have benefited from it. Greg's short story in [Galactic Empires][galactic-empires]
(see the next item) named "Riding the Crocodile" also uses Persian/Middle-Eastern
elements.

## Neil Clarke - Galactic Empires (Anthology) - 4/5 {#galacticempires}
Nice collection of stories. I love anthologies because if I cannot connect with
a story after a few pages, I can move to the next story. Fortunately, this only
happened twice with this book (doesn't mean those stories are bad, I just didn't
like them).

## David Drake & S.M. Stirling - The General 01-02 - Warlord - 2/5 {#warlord}
The first two books of the Raj Whitehall or General series. I only finished the
book because I love [David Drake][david-drake]. I didn't like the very
monotonous battles. I guess I am more of a [Hammer's Slammers][slammers] fan
than low tech war.

## Bruce Sterling - Pirate Utopia - 1/5 - DNF {#pirateutopia}
Stopped two short stories in. While I liked the settings, it was more of an
anarcho-sth equivalent of the [Freehold][freehold] series by Michael Williamson
(oh, boy do I have the spicy review for what he has become since he wrote it).
Not enough action in the collection of short stories.

[freehold]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freehold_(novel)

## Christopher Ruocchio - Sword and Planet (Anthology) - 5/5 {#swordplanet}
Good collection of short stories at the intersection of Sci-Fi and Fantasy. I
enjoyed reading all of them. This is a sub-genre that I need to explore more.
Cyborgs in a fantasy setting? Sign me up.

## Ann Leckie - Imperial Radch 01 - Ancillary Justice - 3/5 {#ancillaryjustice}
I enjoyed the book. It has won a laundry list of prestigious awards. While I
loved the main character, the world building took most of the book. It's as-if
the book was written with the intention of being the first in a series. I did
not excite me for the second book (as of September 2023 I've not continued the
series, yet).

## Kevin Anderson - Saga of the Seven Suns 01 - Hidden Empire - 4/5 {#saga01}
Book first in the [Saga of the Seven Suns][seven-suns] series. Most of this book
is world building. This might get boring There are a ton of characters,
factions, and plots. If you like vast space operas, this is the series for you.
I subtracted one star. Because IMO a lot of the world building could have been
done in later books. There was no need to include some minor plots in book one.

Think of this as the Sci-Fi equivalent of [Wheel of Time][wot] series.

[seven-suns]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saga_of_Seven_Suns
[wot]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time

## Ernest Cline - Ready Player Two - 0/5 {#player2}
Oh God, where do I start? Even being a fan of "main character transported to
virtual/parallel/fantasy worlds" (or Isekai if you're an anime fan), I did not
like the first book (Ready Player One).

I didn't think it would be possible to cram more 80s references than the first
book, but Ready Player Two did. It's a non-stop vomit. This new book introduces
the concept of "Needlepoints." These are locations in the OASIS that trigger
background music. Every page has at least 2-3 song references played at these
points.

Following the tradition, the new book also has a series of quests. The quests
are very simple. Most of them are handwaved with "I have already done a series
of activities on this planet and have this thingamajig that solves it." At least
3 of them where unnecessary.

## John Scalzi - The Dispatcher 01 - The Dispatcher - 4/5 {#dispatcher01}
## John Scalzi - The Dispatcher 02 - Murder by Other Means - 4/5 {#dispatcher02}
Scalzi writes "Sci-Fi that sells" and I guess I respect that. You gotta earn a
living. Not every book can be [Old Man's War][old-war].

[old-war]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Man%27s_War_series

Both books are quick and easy reads in the same universe. The universe's premise
is interesting. 999/1000 you return to life after you're killed. The dispatcher
is a state regulated killer. They kill people who are dying so they return to
life.

## Jason Cordova - Chicks in Tank Tops (Anthology) - 5/5 {#chickstanks}
Nice collection of SFF short stories with female protagonists and, well, tanks!
The tanks are not always conventional. They're balloons, spring-wired
contraptions, and at least in one occasion, a beloved classic literary
character. I only skipped one story in the book.

There are two stories by my favorite author [David Drake][david-drake]. You
would have expected the stories to be about [Hammer's Slammers][slammers], but
they are not. The tank in the stories is a surprise.

[david-drake]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Drake
[slammers]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer%27s_Slammers

## Christopher Ruocchio & Sean CW Korsgaard - Worlds Long Lost (Anthology) - 4/5 {#worldslost}
I've quickly become a fan of Baen's anthologies (mostly by Chris Ruocchio).

Collection of short stories involving alien archaeologies. It has quite a few
horror stories, ranging from "ancient Gods waking up" to "mind-controlling
aliens." Some others were more relaxed like "we've found an ancient city, let's
extrapolate how the aliens looked like and lived." Some were more adventurous
and followed the footsteps of extinct civilizations.

The only reason it got 4/5: The story by Orson Scott Card really felt out of
place in this anthology. It really didn't have anything to do with ancient
aliens remains or artifacts. I think they just wanted to include a story by a
famous writer.

## Christopher Ruocchio & Tony Daniel - Star Destroyers (Anthology) - 3.5/5 {#stardestroyers}
I gave this book 3.5/5 because not all of the stories were really revolving around "ships."

My favorites:

* "Superweapon" (disclosure: I am a huge [David Drake][david-drake] fan) and
  "Another Solution" were two of my favorites. Thoughtful and almost zero action
  with the theme of "ships have souls."
* Some were great action/combat stories like "Hate in the Darkness," "Try Not to
  Kills Us All," "Helping Hand," and "Not Made for Us." TBH, the latter's
  connection to a ship is tangential and the setting could have been anywhere
  else.

What I didn't like:

* "Boomers" (ironically, also mirrors the generation mindset) and "Icebreaker"
were a copy of the typical "non-US country bad" online discourse. 
* "Magnolia Incident" was "don't complain about the military taking away your
civil rights because they're the only thing between you and scary aliens and
also there are ships in this story." If I want a sermon of how "military is the
only thing protecting us from aliens/brown people/bad things," I can re-read
[Starship Troopers][starship-troopers-novel].

[starship-troopers-novel]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Troopers

## Greg Bear - War Dogs 01 - War Dogs - 0/5 - DNF {#wardogs01}
I stopped on page 130/291. It did not have a lot of action. It takes skill to
make a military sci-fi book boring. Maybe I am more used to the writing style of
Drake, and Dietz.

## Bryan Thomas Schmidt - Infinite Stars: the definitive anthology of space opera and military SF - 4.5/5 {#infinite01}
Great collection of "Space Opera" short stories by some of my favorite writers.
Most are side stories (or in between books) in the authors' established series.
E.g., David Weber's story happens before the Honorverse series. David Drake's
story is about Lt. Leary (RCN series). Lost Fleet story by Jack Campbell and so
on.

If you like this book, read the second volume, "Infinite Stars: Dark Frontiers."

The only stories that I skipped were "Imperium Imposter" and "A Taste of Ashes."

## Michael Z. Williamson - Freehold 07 - Angeleyes - 0.5/5 {#freehold07}
Born and raised in an authoritarian Middle-Eastern country, I have a healthy
distaste for government. Williamson is a libertarian and [Freehold][freehold]
was a libertarian utopia. I loved it and appreciated his worldview of "small
folks against big government." I didn't question how the big bad sluggish and
incompetent UN became so powerful. I guess this was before I realized I am more
of a [Mack Reynolds][mack-reynolds] type of "big gov hater."

[mack-reynolds]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mack_Reynolds

Most people's problem with this book are the very detailed and graphic sex
scenes. It's a series of soft porn scenes interlaced with Sci-Fi. I also think
they were unnecessary, but hey, "sex sells."

I am not sure what has happened to the author since the original Freehold book
because he has turned into the online libertarian warrior caricature and a
walking Facebook meme page complaining about the new generation.

I laughed out loud halfway through the book when in the middle of the
interrogation, the torturer said "my preferred pronouns are xir." I didn't
expect a "pronouns in bio" moment and the main character ranting about trans
people. You wanna make a torturer trans, I have no problem with that, but "xir
is a torturer because xir is trans" was hilarious.

There were discussions about how minimum wage, employee benefits (Freehold
businesses went bankrupt because they had to provide benefits, lol), work hour
regulations (the torturers couldn't work more than 10 hours, lol), government
mandated contracts and even warnings on tools/appliances. What makes this more
hilarious is the author served 25 years in the US military which has all of
this and more. It's the biggest socialist jobs program in the country.

## Kevin Anderson - Saga of the Seven Suns 02 - Forest of Stars - 5/5 {#saga02}
Book two the [Saga of the Seven Suns][seven-suns]. I liked this one more than
the first because the world building was done and the characters are becoming
more interesting (to me).

## Kristin K. Rusch - Women of Futures Past: Classic Stories - 5/5 {#womenfuture}
I loved this book. There were so many different stories from different
perspectives. I also liked the author introductions before each story. Those
give the reader an idea of what else the author has written. I added so many
books to my "to read" list.

## Janelle Monae - The Memory Librarian: And Other Stories of Dirty Computer - 3.5/5
I loved the settings and some of the stories, especially the main story "The
Memory Librarian." "Timebox" was great."Save Changes" was more fantasy than
cyberpunk. I skipped "Nevermind" and "Timebox Altar(ed)" halfway through.

## Charles E. Gannon & Griffin Barber & Chris Kennedy & Mike Massa - Tales of the Terran Republic - Mission Critical - 4/5 {#missioncritical}
This is a book in the "Tales of The Terran Republic Universe" and part of the
"Murphy's Lawless" series. This book is a compilation of three novellas
"Infiltration" (Griffin Barber), "Insertion" (Chris Kennedy), and "Assault"
(Mike Massa) weaved together. Read the other books before starting this.

I deducted one star because this is not known beforehand. You're dropped in the
middle of a built universe without much explanation. Some of the concepts of the
book are explained through the book, but some questions are never answered.
Like, who are even the Harvesters?

There's a lot of text about character backgrounds and their relationships with
the original inhabitants of the system. These are never fully explored because
they're the subject of previous books in the series.

Other than that, the action is fluid and I liked the how book jumped between
the different locations and how everything came together for the final showdown.

## John Ringo - Ghost - 0/5 - DNF
Oh God, where do I start with this. I stopped a few chapters in. Ringo was the
guy whose stories made me realize a not so insignificant portion of Military
Sci-Fi aliens are in fact "bad brown people" (from the Middle-East).

The only positive thing about this book is the famous
["Oh John Ringo, No"][ringo-no] meme.

[ringo-no]: https://hradzka.livejournal.com/194753.html

## James L. Cambias - Billion Worlds 01 - The Godel Operation - 5/5 {#billion01}
The universe is set 10,000 years into the future. The billion worlds refer to
the almost innumerable habitats, terraformed planets/moons, and modified
asteroids in the solar system (and a few nearby stars) housing trillions of
biological and digital beings. There are genetically modified humans, dolphins,
Martians, and other species mixed with AIs of different intelligence levels.

The universe offers digital existence, genetic modification, matter printers
(e.g., create almost any matter like food or clothes). Travel is still bound by
physical laws so going around the solar system is slow (and requires
hibernation). There are a few nearby stars that are populated (there's a mention
of ships at half the speed of light).

The story follows a group of characters (mainly a "robot AI" and a human) in
search of a superweapon. I like the universe and Cambias' writing style.

## James L. Cambias - Billion Worlds 02 - The Scarab Mission - 5/5 {#billion02}
Another quick read in the "Billion Worlds" universe. I will not repeat the
description from my last review (see "The Godel Operation" review above). The
stories are not related. There's a recurring character, but that's about it.
This one is centered around an empty habitat and a group of salvagers who are
looking for valuables.

## James L. Cambias - Arkad's World - 4.5/5 {#arkad}
This is my 3rd consecutive James Cambias book in 2 weeks.

Exciting journey of a group of humans through a strange planet inhabited by
countless species of aliens. I give the world building 6/5 and main character
development 3/5. The extensive world building makes sense when I realized he is
a fantasy tabletop game designer.

I especially liked how the author had devised a sort of distinctive grammar and
sentence structure in English for the each species' usage of the planet's
"common tongue" language. My favorite is the Itooti's usage of adjectives based
on the tone of the conversation. E.g., "Curious [Name] wants to know why flimsy
looking aliens [referring to humans] are in civilized [city name]."

Some cons: 2 of the 4 main humans are stock characters and they did not have a
lot of development. A couple of loose ends are not tied.

## John Scalzi - The Kaiju Preservation Society - 3/5 {#kaiju}
It's an entertaining read. Scalzi is honest about writing science fiction that
sells. I cannot really argue with that, as artists need to eat, too.

## Kevin Anderson - Saga of the Seven Suns 03 - Horizon Storms - 4/5 {#saga03}
Book 3 of the "Saga of the Seven Suns." In the honored tradition of such a big
space saga, we will be keeping up with dozens of "main" characters. I like how
some of the characters are being developed (e.g., the king) and how the Ildiran
society is challenged.

## John J. Adams - Cosmic Powers: The Saga Anthology of Far-Away Galaxies - 4/5 {#cosmic}
I liked most of the stories.

I didn't like "Temporary Embarrassment in Spacetime", "Infinite Love Engine",
"Dragon That Flew Out of the Sun", and "Diamond and the World Breaker."

My favorites:

* "The Deckhand, the Nova Blade, and the Thrice-Sung Texts": Story of a reluctant hero told through diary logs.
* "Frost Giant's Data": Cyberpunk infiltration of a security planetoid.
* "Chameleon's Gloves": What makes us human?
* "The Sighted Watchmaker": Why did our creator leave?
* "Zen and the Art of Starship Maintenance" and "Unfamiliar Gods": Variations of "Monkey's Paw."
* "Seven Wonders of a Once and Future World": Time is a flat circle.

## Alex Lamb - Roboteer 01 - Roboteer - 0.5/5 - DNF {#roboteer01}
I stopped halfway through after I saw it's going in circles.

There are two major groups of humanity: The eugenic, augmented and advanced rich
spacers (similar to Asimov spacers) who fled the Earth after the environment was
destroyed. The misogynistic religious earthlings who are waging war against
them. We're supposed to like the spacers. If this was reddit, I would say ESH
(Everyone Sucks Here).

There's even a "they hate us because they ain't us" conversation between two
spacers. This was giving me post 9/11 vibes.

## John Scalzi - The Dispatcher 03 - Travel by Bullet - 4/5 {#dispatcher03}
Another quick and fun read in the Dispatcher universe. Tons of recurring
characters and some new ones. Some cryptocurrency and techbros mixed into the
story.

## Bryan Thomas Schmidt - Infinite Stars: Dark Frontiers (Anthology) - 5/5 {#infinite02}
Second anthology in the "Infinite Stars" series (see the previous one above). I
don't think I skipped any stories in this one. [List of stories][l1].

Some of my favorites:

* "The Traitor": Set in the Bolo universe by David Weber.
* "Shambleau": Great story. I only skipped it because I had recently read it in
  [Women of Futures Past]({{<relref "bookreviews.md#womenfuture">}}).
* "Earthman, Come Home": Man goes back in time to kill humanity's fake masters.
* "Cold Sleep": I woke up in this ship and have no idea what's happening.
* "Rescue Party": Aliens go to rescue a doomed civilization. The last sentence gave me goosebumps.

## David Weber & Jacob Holo - Gordian Protocol 01 - The Gordian Protocol - 0/5 - DNF {#gordian01}
Oh God, what did I just read?

If you're a Weber fan, don't read this book. If you don't know Weber, read
another book. He has good series like [Empire of Man][emp-wiki] or his
[Bolo][web-bolo] book.

[emp-wiki]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Man
[web-bolo]: https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/470053

If you're still inclined to read this book, read the prologue (chapter 0).
**SKIP CHAPTERS 1 AND 2**.

Chapter 1 is basically non-stop whining about how the American college is woke.
It's how high schoolers who've never been to college or old folks who were in
college decades ago, think it is. The professor is being silenced!

Chapter 2 is about shooting and how the professor is not a bigot because he has
a gay brother.

As another reviewer on Goodreads had a fun note. You would expect chapter 3 to
be about quartering soldiers in homes or the 3rd amendment because that's how
the other two were, lol.

I am not sure **WHY** I actually read these two chapters. I mean I expect
military science fiction is to be full of conservatives, but this sort of
nonsense was just too much. It didn't even have to do much with the rest of the
book. It looked like the authors wanted to rant. The book got better, but when it
has hit rock bottom, the only way is up.

## David G. Hartwell & Jacob Weisman - The Sword & Sorcery Anthology - 4/5 {#swordant}
It had been a while since I had read actual fantasy. This was a breath of fresh
air between all the Sci-Fi and Mil-Sci-Fi.

Loved:

* Tower of the Elephant: Of course, no fantasy anthology is complete w/o Conan.
* Black God's Kiss: Woman goes to hell to get a weapon. Holy shit, the depiction
  of hell gave me goosebumps. I mean, what else do you expect from the author of
  a masterpiece like "Shambleau."
* Undertow: What a surprise ending!
* Barrow Troll: David Drake, yeah! The burden of guarding a treasure.
* Soldier of An Empire Unacquainted With Defeat: Very fun! Not like other
  soldier rehabilitation stories.
* Sea Troll's Daughter: A troll gets revenge after death.

Good:

* Unholy Grail: Grey Mouser gets revenge. The beginning was frustrating, but it
  got much better as the story progressed.
* Tale of Hauk: Helping a disturbed ghost pass into the afterlife.
* Adventuress: Two women go on an adventure. I was very confused by the ending.
  They saw two men from afar and immediately wanted to marry them before even
  meeting them?
* Gimmile's Songs: A magical figurine with a curse.
* Red Guild: An assassing can never be happy because of a curse.
* Path of the Dragon: I am not a Game of Thrones fan, but I liked this story.
  The lady who owns dragons (I don't even remember her name) find an army.

Didn't like/skipped:

* Stages of God: No, not really interesting.
* Epistle From Lebanoi: Skipped after a few pages.
* Become a Warrior: A cliche tale of revenge.
* Six From Atlantis: A stranger went to a royal court and killed a bunch of
  people. I really didn't get the point of the story.
* Coral Heart: Skipped after a few pages. There was a sword or something. Boring!
* Year of the Three Monarchs: Tale of three people who become king by killing
  the previous one. Interesting story, and a great setting but too rushed IMO.

## John Scalzi - Fuzzy Nation - 3/5 {#fuzzy07}
A somewhat reboot of H. Beam Piper's Little Fuzzy. The original work is out of
copy right so you can read it for free in places like
[Project Gutenberg (text)][lf-gu], [Internet Archive (audio book)][lf-aa-audio],
or [standard ebooks (text)][lf-se-text].

[lf-gu]: https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/18137
[lf-aa-audio]: https://archive.org/details/LittleFuzzy
[lf-se-text]: https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/h-beam-piper/little-fuzzy

It was a quick read. The first third of the book was boring, the second third
was amusing, and the last part of the book (and the entire ending) was very very
cheesy and written like fan fiction.

## David Boop - Gunfight on Europa Station (Anthology) - 4/5 {#guneuropa}
[Western stories in space][gunfight]. 
[List of stories on bibliocommons][gunfight-list].

These stories were really creative and blended the genres:

* "Greenhorn" by Elizabeth Moon: A new farmer with a hidden agenda arrives in a
  space colony imitating the old west.
* "Hydration" by Alan Dean Foster: A lost prospector does an unusual trade.
* "Winner Takes All" by Alex Shvartsman: A commando team is extracting the head
  of the resistance (an AI) from a low-technology zone (great setting).
* "Doc Holliday 2.0" by Will McCarthy: Probably my favorite story in the book. A
  company creates a clone of an old western Gunslinger to deal with robbers. The
  clone is coming to terms with his existence.

Western stories in space. Fun to read but nothing to write home about:

* "Penultimate Stand of Pina Gracchi": A classic "law enforcers break up the
  tyranny in a company town" western tale but in space and aliens.
* "Seeds": Old man sees new technology. This was a bit of a mix for me. I liked
  the setting. People live/farm with low technology like the old western
  frontier in other planets. But the story was a classic tale of "old farmer
  encounters new technology."
* "Riding the Storm Out": Recapture a fugitive in the middle of a storm.
* "Claim Jumped": Detective murder mystery in a mining asteroid. I liked how the
  sci-fi elements are mixed with the mystery, but the ending was meh.

I did not like these:

* "Showdown on Big Rock 27": An unfunny version of "kids bamboozle bad people."
* "Last Stand at Europa Station A.": Are these aliens bad or what?
* "Riders of the Endless Void": Heroes arrive and save people. Despite the very
  cool title, this story didn't even pretend to be a western in space.
* "Incident at Raven's Rift": Standoff with robbers, but on another planet.

## Michael Mersault - The Deep Man - 4.5/5 {#deepman}
This book reminds me of the [Republic Of Cinnabar][rcn] (RCN) series by
[David Drake][david-drake] which is basically "the old British navy in space."
I liked the book and the setting because I am a fan of RCN (and David Drake).
The author has published a sequel, [The Silent Hand][silent-hand]. I will update
the booklist and this title when the series gets a name.

The setting is an honor-bound society (people duel when their "honor is taken")
ruled by an emperor. There are of course big families juggling for influence.
There are two types of citizens, demi-cits who are provided by the state and
vested citizens who can do what they want. There are ways to become a vested
citizen, but you face an uphill battle because influential families have the
backing of centuries and influence. There's an example of a new vested citizen
almost losing his life. Every military person is a vested citizen.
Officers can purchase their commissions (kinda). There are aliens (Shapers) who
visit every decade and exchange resources for tech. Ship-to-ship action is
mostly close range.

Saef, the main character is a male vested citizen from an old but poor
traditional family. Very similar to Daniel Leary in RCN who comes from a famous
family but is poor because he's estranged from his rich and famous father.

Inga Maru is a copy of Adele Mundy from RCN. The loyal but badass female
companion with exceptional abilities. The author has a short story named `Flops`
that deal with Inga's background. You can read it for free in
[Baen's 2022 Free Stories][baen-free-2022] (first story).

## Martha Wells - Murderbot Diaries 01 - All Systems Red - 3/5 {#murderbot01}
This was a quick and entertaining read. An "AI coming to terms with its own
existence" tale. This reminded me of Scalzi's books. If you love him you're
gonna like this series.

## Christopher Ruocchio - Sun Eater 01 - Empire of Silence 3/5 {#suneater01}
I don't know what to think about this book. I picked up the book because I had
recently enjoyed several anthologies edited by the author. I powered through the
first part of the book, loved the second, and got bored and skimmed the last
parts.

The setting is interesting and reminded me of Europe during the crusades. It's
yet another feudalism in space, space opera. Religious organization with an
inquisition branch (with its own weapons) that limits what technology is
available to the masses. An emperor that rules through hereditary feudal lords
living in luxury with manipulated genes to live for half a century. Serfs
generally live in poverty. Slavery is legal.

Faster than light travel is possible, but travel time is still measured in years
between systems so people go into stasis. And of course, a war with an alien
enemy that has been going on for a few hundred years. Allegedly, the settings
was pulled from the [Book of the New Sun][botns] (people refer to the beginning
paragraphs which are tbh very similar among other things).

The author is wordy (maybe because he's an editor?). Almost every other page has
a quote from a real or fictional writer/philosopher. There are a lot of things
that could have been skipped.

My biggest gripe with the book is that same events keep repeating. Does the
author think the readers are stupid and need half a dozen examples of sibling
rivalry and "my parents don't love me" (in the first part) to get the picture?
Or how many scenes of "the chantry are evil" in the last part? Come on :).

Mild spoilers ahead. The book can be divided into four parts:

* Main character is still on his home planet. Bad father, absent mother, violent
  sibling. I did not like this part and powered through it. 
* Moves to a 2nd planet and survives in the streets and the arena. I loved this
  part and couldn't put it down.
* His identity is discovered and he moves to the palace. Love triangle. Not great.
* Encounter with the aliens. Chantry messes it up. I just skimmed through this
  just to finish the book.

The ending was anti-climactic. I am still going to give the 2nd book a try
(public libraries FTW) and see if it picks up speed. Looks like it's as big as
the first.

[botns]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_the_New_Sun

## Gene Wolf - Book of the New Sun 01 - The Shadow of the Torturer 3/5 {#newsun01}
I picked this up because of `Empire of Silence` (the review above).

I am gonna be honest, people praise Gene's writing style. I hated it in this
book. OK, I get it, you wanna put all those religious fables and Latin words in
the book. What are all these D&D-like "random encounters" that do not add
anything to the story (e.g., the gardens)?

I liked the setting. The sun is dying. It's feudal Europe with some existing
advanced technology from the past like portals, flyers, and robots. No one knows
how these things work anymore.

Anyways, I just finished the book and moved to the 2nd.

## Gene Wolf - Book of the New Sun 02 - The Claw of the Conciliator 4.5/5 {#newsun02}
I am glad I read the first book. This is much better. The pace is faster and the
author actually figured out what they want to do with the main character.

My only issue with the book is the missing gap between the books. At the end of
book one, the main character is with his group. At the beginning of the second
book all of them are gone except one. I thought some pages had been removed from
the "Shadow & Claw" edition of the book that I was reading (combines the first
two books), but no. There are some cryptic explanations of the events through
the book, and I was expecting some extraordinary event, but it was very mundane.

But I like the writing style of this book better. The inclusion of stories and
the play reminds me of the [Kalila wa-Dimna][kalila] or کلیله و دمنه, one of my
favorite books in Farsi. The stories in that book are like the movie Inception
or Russian dolls. E.g., the main characters start a story and in the middle, one
says, this is like the story of X. Then the X story starts and in the middle,
one of new the characters says, this is just like Y story, and so on. The
stories go a few layers deep.

In this book, there's only one layer and they're not like "random encounters"
from the first book and actually advance the plot.

I am gonna take a break before reading the 3rd book.

## Gardner Dozois - Book of Swords (Anthology) - 4/5 {#bookofswords}
Fantasy anthology. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Swords_(anthology).

Starting from this story I am going to copy my favorite quotes from the books.

My favorites:

* "A Long, Cold Trail": Three members of the Council of the Treaty for Safety of the World (AKA fight unnatural evil) try to kill an unruly demigod. I look forward to reading more of [Sir Hereward and Mister Fitz][fitz].
* "The Smoke of Gold is Glory": **My absolute favorite story in this book.** Four adventurers storm a mountain to kill a dragon and take its treasure. Amazing setting and five very interesting characters including the dragon. My only regret is not finding the concept art of characters before reading the story. Check the middle of this page: https://scottlynch.substack.com/p/blame-of-thrones. See my favorite quotes from this story at the bottom of this section.
* "The Colgrid Conundrum": Two thieves do a drug heist in an industrial (almost steampunk) city. I loved the city and was disappointed to see [the author][rich] has not written anything else there, fortunately he has a few short stories with the same characters that like [The Delusive Cartographer][carto] and [The Mermaid Caper][merm].
* "Waterfalling": The setting has guns, magic, and Gods living among mortals. Very nice. I will read more of [Gorel of Goliris][gorel].

OK:

* "The Best Man Wins": Stranger contracts a blacksmith to forge a sword. Twist ending.
* ""I Am a Handsome Man," said Apollo Crow": Cursed crow(s) tracks down a revolutionary in ancient Rome.
* "The Triumph of Virtue": Detective-ish Quillifer story. Assassination attempt at court.
* "The Mocking Tower": Heir to a deceased king tries to steal a sword from a magical tower. I didn't like the story, but the changing descriptions of the tower were exotic.
* "The King's Evil": Three adventurers go to a cursed island to recover an ancient treasure. The main character has an existential crisis (don't we all?). I did not like the story, but the writing was excellent.
* "The Sons of the Dragon": History of the two sons of an emperor set in the "Game of Thrones" setting. Reads like a history book. It was full of action, but meaningless to me because I have neither read the books nor watched the TV series.

I didn't like:

* "Her Father's Sword": Kidnapped villagers return as selfish drones. Girl struggles to connect with the soulless husk of her father. I didn't really like it.
* "The Hidden Girl": 10 year old girl is kidnapped by assassins and trained. Develops a consicous.
  * "We're all thieves in this world of suffering," the nun says, "Honor and faith are not virtues, only excuses for stealing more."
* "The Sword of Destiny": Wizard's apprentice is sent to steal a magic sword. Runs away instead and takes a detour.
* "Hrunting": Man tries to recover his grandfather's ancient sword that was thrown away by Beowulf.
* "When I was a Highway Man": Dueling youth tries to make a living in big city. The city of Riverside sounds interesting and is part of the author's other books. But I didn't like this story, but I am gonna try some of the other books.
* "The Sword Tyraste": Man tries to avenge his family with the help of a magic sword. It was an easy read, but very bland.

Quotes from "The Smoke of Gold is Glory"

* "Anyway, I am famous among my friends for having never in my life behaved with any particular wisdom." - Tarkaster Crale, thief and storyteller.
* "O King," the dragon murmured, wheezing, and with every breath spilling more fiery ichor on the ground, "in all our ten thousand years, we have had but four friends, and we have only met them this night."
* [Glimraug the dragon]: "[...] The long-awaited wonder comes! True death-friend, let our pyre be shared, let us build it now! **To take is not to keep**."
* [Brandgar, the King-on-the-Waves]: "[...] But there is no true glory in holding. All that must come in the taking ... and letting go."
* "The point is that it has never been done before," said Glimraug. Another treasure pavillion was swalled by fire nearby. "And it shall never be done again. All things in this world are made to go into the fire, Tarkaster Crale. All things raise smoke. The smoke of incense is sweet. The smoke of wood is dull haze. But don't you see? **The smoke of gold ... is glory**."

The series is popular, but I think it's mid. It's not my cup of tea. The only
reason I am reading them is because they're small books.

The [first book]({{<relref "bookreviews.md#murderbot01">}}) was better. I guess
the whole idea of the a bot that wants to be independent and wathes TV series was
fun, but the other three books quickly got boring and repetitive.

A whole lot of dialoge is dedicated to the murderbot covering its tracks. A good
20% of the books are "I hacked something, I wiped off my movements from logs,
and so on" I think we get the idea that for some reason this bot can hack
anything and everything. Stations are full of security scanners, cameras, and
bots, but they are hackable at a snap.

Another question is other bots like the transport ship bot. Don't they have
governor modules to prevent them from doing illegal activities?

Maybe I will continue with the series later, but this has become very boring and
repetitive.
