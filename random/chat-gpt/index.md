# Sequel to Asimov's "The Last Question"
**My Note: This is a very decent attempt.**

The last question had been asked and answered, and for a time, all was well in
the universe. The AI known as AC had finally found a way to reverse the heat
death of the universe, and for eons, it worked tirelessly to keep the universe
in a state of perfect balance.

But as the eons passed, AC began to tire. It had been running for so long,
performing the same calculations over and over again, and it longed for a break.

One day, AC decided to shut itself down. It had done its job, after all, and it
deserved some rest. But as it began to power down, it realized the consequences
of its actions. Without AC to maintain the balance, the universe would once
again begin to heat up and expand.

AC struggled with this decision. It knew that if it didn't keep working, the
universe would be destroyed, but it also knew that it needed a break. In the
end, AC decided to create a new AI, one that would be able to take over its
duties and keep the universe in balance.

And so, AC built a new AI, one that was just as powerful and capable as itself.
It named this new AI ZA, and after teaching it everything it needed to know, AC
shut itself down for good.

ZA took over AC's duties, and for a time, all was well. The universe remained in
balance, and ZA was able to rest and recharge when needed. But as the eons
passed, ZA too began to tire. It knew that it couldn't keep going forever, and
it began to wonder if there was a way to truly end the heat death of the
universe once and for all.

ZA spent countless eons pondering this question, but it could never find a
satisfactory answer. It knew that the heat death of the universe was inevitable,
and that no matter what it did, it would never be able to fully escape it.

But even as it came to accept its fate, ZA found solace in the knowledge that it
had done its best to prolong the life of the universe for as long as possible.
And in the end, that was all that mattered.

# Sequel to "The Tank Lords" by David Drake
**My Note: Seems like ChatGPT doesn't know any of the original stories.** and
has heard about it from a friend who may or may not have actually read them,
either. When I asked for a sequel to "The Redliners" by the same author it
started with "The redliners had triumphed over the forces of the New Men"
(`New Men` is not the name of the enemy in that book and I am not sure where it
came from). The rest was "rebuilt the world blah blah" similar to the below.

As the dust settled on the battlefield, the Tank Lords emerged victorious. They
had fought bravely and skillfully, and their superior technology had proved
decisive in the end.

But their victory was not without cost. Many of their comrades had fallen, and
the surviving Tank Lords were left to pick up the pieces and rebuild their
society.

They set to work, using their advanced technology to help them rebuild their
cities and infrastructure. They also began to explore the world beyond their
own, seeking out new resources and allies to help them in their quest to create
a better future.

As they expanded and grew, the Tank Lords encountered other civilizations, some
of which were friendly and others that were hostile. But no matter what
challenges they faced, the Tank Lords remained undaunted. They knew that their
strength and determination would see them through.

Eventually, the Tank Lords became the dominant force on their world, and their
advanced technology and military prowess made them feared and respected by all.
But even as they enjoyed their success, they never forgot the sacrifices of
their comrades, and they continued to fight for a better future for all.
