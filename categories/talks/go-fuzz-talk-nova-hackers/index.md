title: "Coverage Guided Fuzzing with Go-Fuzz @ NoVA Hackers"
wip: false
---

I did a talk at NoVA Hackers on using Go-Fuzz.

* [Slides in PDF](coverage-guided-fuzzing.pdf).
* [Slides using go-talks.appspot.com](https://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/parsiya/Parsia-Clone/tree/master/categories/talks/go-fuzz-talk-nova-hackers/coverage-guided-fuzzing.slide): Looks much nicer then PDF.
* Using the [Go present](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/present) you can view the slides locally in your browser.
