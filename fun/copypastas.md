## Rust Copypasta
Of course Rust is superior to `[insert programming language]`. You should use
Rust for `[insert project]` because you get:

* Zero-cost abstractions
* Move semantics
* Guaranteed memory safety
* Threads without data races
* Trait-based generics
* Pattern matching
* Type inference
* Minimal runtime
* Efficient C bindings

And last but not least:
* **Fearless concurrency**

Note: I am not joking about `Fearless Concurrency` see:  
https://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/04/10/Fearless-Concurrency.html

* Cannot create a DLL from your package. Is this still true?
* Horrible error handling. Half of your code will be the following (Atom even
  has a snippet for it, type `iferr` and press enter):

``` go
funcReturn, err := func()
if err != nil {
  return  // pro error handling
}
```

* The opening curly braces must be on the same line as the statement. Below is
  correct:

``` go
if whatever > 10 {
  // do whatever
}
```

But this is wrong:

``` go
if whatever > 10
{
  // do whatever
}
```
They justify it [in the FAQ](https://golang.org/doc/faq#semicolons). They are
Google, they are special.

## Seinfeld and JavaScript by Jamie
What is the deal with JavaScript? Is it a java or is it a script?

And don't get me started on just how messy JavaScript is. It's not cleanly
compiled like Java or C++ and it's not held in a walled garden and interpreted
like PHP. It just goes everywhere. And when it does get somewhere it's not
supposed to, it goes terribly."

Your server hands JavaScript to the browser and the browser just innocently
accepts it. It runs it. I mean, what kind of a rube just executes code like
that? Internet Explorer. That's who.

So anyway, I'm testing this web app and I see a button. It's an innocent, nice
little button, but I'm a dick. So I decide to type in some JavaScript, click the
button, and off it goes. My browser refreshes and then that JavaScript comes
back. It's messy. CSS Elements are flying everywhere. The browser is throwing
alerts like crazy. But that's not the worst part. I go to the developers and
they're like 'but we blacklisted the < character'. You blacklisted it? Like
that's going to keep some guy from just encoding it? So I sent him a kindly
worded email that I was a crown prince of Nigeria and long story short, I'm rich
now.

Thank you! Try the veal, tip your waitress, I'll be here all week!
