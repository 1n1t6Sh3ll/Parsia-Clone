# Challenges
Do at least one daily challenge every day. The streak will increase the gold
payout. This section has my notes about how to complete them quickly-ish.

## General

### Desert Sage
Between the two `O`s in Gaptooth Ridge on the map. Near Tumbleweed.

### Alligators
Around Lagras lake. Use the Lagras fast travel point.

### Longnose Garl
Go to the inlet north of `Saint Denis`. On the map, almost right on top of the
`E` in `Lemoyne`.

* Bait: Crayfish. Buy from the bait shop further north.

Press the middle mouse button (eagle eye) to see the fish. You are looking for
the big ones.

## Collector
Collector challenges are mostly straight forward and can be completed quickly by
using the [collector's map][collectors-map].

### Yates Diamond Ring
To force respawn, go to the location western edge of the map (not south west,
just west). North of `Little Creek River` and north of `E` in West Elizabeth on
the map is a group of houses. The ring is in a lock box on the top floor of the
house. If it's not there, press escape to open the menu, select `Online` and
then `Free Roam`. You will be back in the same area and the ring has respawned.
You can do it once per reset.

**Possible with other jewelry?**

# Buy the Outlaw Pass
I got the Outlaw Pass 4. I bought the gold with microtransactions but I had
bought the stand alone game for 5 USD. The pass gave me 15% and then 30% role
bonus which helped me make more gold and money. It also gave me back 30 gold
bars along with a 10 gold bar discount on the bounty hunter license. So it
pretty much paid itself back.

Getting to rank 100 in the pass was not that hard. Considering the XP needed for
every rank is the same (and does not exponentially go up). It's a quick thing.

# What to Buy When Starting Out?
Start with the Collector's track. Go to Madam Nazar and buy the bag. It costs 15
gold bars. Then you can start collecting. Use this amazing map to figure
out what is where and collect everything around you.

When starting out you probably do not have the gold bars to buy anything. I
bought gold with cash which was worth it for me because I did not want to grind
challenges for a few weeks.

Then buy the shovel and then the metal detector. Be sure to **buy the shovel
first**, because the metal detector is useless without the shovel.

On consoles, the controller vibrates when you have the metal detector out and
you are around special locations. On PC you gotta go to first person (press `v`)
and then see where the detector starts blinking more rapidly.

I still do not know if it's possible to find things with the metal detector that
are not marked on the map above. Do I go around with the detector in my hand and
hope to find things? I dunno. I am on PC so I cannot rely on the controller
vibration.

After doing missions, delivery sessions, events and more, you will have enough
cash and gold to buy the other items for professions. If you are not in a hurry
and you can wait, wait for a weekly bonus that has the items at a discount. For
example, I started the hunter track with a discount and bought the Naturalist
role item a few weeks later when it was 15 gold bars instead of 25.

# Hunting in Bayou Nwa
I put my camp in Bayou Nwa. I go around the Lagras lake and kill the large
alligators. There are usually a few spawn around the camp. So I can quickly kill
them. The alligators are not that valuable but they are easy to kill and do not
run away unless you shoot them directly.

Shoot them with the bolt action rifle in the head so the pelt quality does not
go down. The smaller alligators that you can pick up are more valuable.

The alligator snapping turtles are considered large animals so you should shoot
them in the head with a rifle. They are also and are usually sedated with three
shots to the head, so good for those "sample two creatures in 10 minutes"
challenges.

You will get a lot of big game meat from the alligators. Large alligators drop 5
pieces and the maximum is 20. Fortunately, one of the superior stew recipes
needs 3 big game meats so you can always create stew. When going to the butcher,
you can see 20 of them for $15 which is OK money. Be sure to sell all of your
big game meat at the butcher because you will be getting a tone of them.

Skin the birds and sell the feathers. Do not donate them to Cripps. Kill them
with the Varmint rifle.

One annoying issue with carcasses is them disappearing when they go off screen.
Even if I am only 30 seconds of running away.

## Selling Items to Gus vs. Donating
It's preferable to donate items but you can also sell items to Gus so he can
craft items and trinkets for you. Especially, you should go for the
`Buck Antler Trinket` which somewhat helps and preserves pelt quality. If you
shoot a 3 star animal the pelt quality might not drop.

To make the trinket, you need a `Dane Topaz Necklace`, two buck antlers and some
cash. Trinkets stack, so buy as many as you can afford and think are useful.

## The Hunting Wagon
I would say it's not really a necessity. It is of course convenient if I find a
bunch of animals in the wild and I kill them.

It also spawns only on major roads so be sure to do it there. The reddit
comments mentioned looking at the ground in first person when summoning. Because
it gets summoned out of sight looking down might help? I have not been able to
prove this.

One good thing about the wagon is that you can put stuff in it and then dismiss
it. Later in camp or at the shop you can summon it. The stuff on the wagon
persist between sessions.

It has a capacity of 10 points for carcasses and big pelts (e.g., alligator
pelts). Each large carcass or pelt is 2 points, each small carcass (e.g., birds)
is 1. I do not think there is a limit on the number of non-large pelts (the ones
you can stow on the horse without taking space).

It's very fragile. I have had my wagon break down when going through mud.

One trick to make things easier:

1. Hunt with the horse.
2. When the horse is full or you are near a main road with a bunch of carcasses.
3. Unload everything from the horse.
4. Summon the wagon.
5. Drop everything in the wagon.
6. Dismiss the wagon.
