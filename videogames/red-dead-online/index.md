# Buy the Outlaw Pass
I got the Outlaw Pass 4. I bought the gold with microtransactions but I had
bought the stand alone game for 5 USD. The pass gave me 15% and then 30% role
bonus which helped me make more gold and money. It also gave me back 30 gold
bars along with a 10 gold bar discount on the bounty hunter license. So it
pretty much paid itself back.

Getting to rank 100 in the pass was not that hard. Considering the XP needed for
every rank is the same (and does not exponentially go up). It's a quick thing.

# What to Buy When Starting Out?
Start with the Collector's track. Go to Madam Nazar and buy the bag. I think it
is 15 gold bars. Then you can start collecting. Use this amazing map to figure
out what is where and collect everything around you.

Then buy the shovel and then the metal detector. Be sure to buy the shovel
first, because the metal detector is useless without the shovel.

On consoles, the controller vibrates when you have the metal detector out and
you are around special locations. On PC you gotta go to first person (press `v`)
and then see where the detector starts blinking more rapidly.

I still do not know if it's possible to find things with the metal detector that
are not marked on the map above. Do I go around with the detector in my hand and
hope to find things? I dunno. I am on PC so I cannot rely on the controller
vibration.

After doing missions, delivery sessions, events and 

# Hunting in Bayou Nwa
I put my camp in Bayou Nwa. I go around the Lagras lake and kill the large
alligators. There are usually a few spawn around the camp. So I can quickly kill
them. The alligators are not that valuable but they are easy to kill and do not
run away unless you shoot them directly.

Shoot them with the bolt action rifle in the head so the pelt quality does not
go down. The smaller alligators that you can pick up are more valuable.

The snapping turtles are considered large animals so you should shoot them in
the head with a rifle.

Skin the birds and sell the feathers. Do not donate them to Cripps. Kill them
with the Varmint rifle.

One annoying issue with carcasses is them disappearing when they go off screen.
Even if I am only 30 seconds of running away.

## The Hunting Wagon
I would say it's not really a necessity. It is of course convenient if I find a
bunch of animals in the wild and I kill them.

It also spawns only on major roads so be sure to do it there.

One good thing about the wagon is that you can put stuff in it and then dismiss
it. Later in camp or at the shop you can summon it. The stuff on the wagon
persist between sessions.

It has a capacity of 10 points for carcasses and big pelts (e.g., alligator
pelts). Each large carcass or pelt is 2 points, each small carcass (e.g., birds)
is 1. I do not think there is a limit on the number of non-large pelts (the ones
you can stow on the horse without taking space).

It's very fragile. I have had my wagon break down when going through mud.

One trick to make things easier:

1. Hunt with the horse.
2. When the horse is full or you are near a main road with a bunch of carcasses.
3. Unload everything from the horse.
4. Summon the wagon.
5. Drop everything in the wagon.
6. Dismiss the wagon.
