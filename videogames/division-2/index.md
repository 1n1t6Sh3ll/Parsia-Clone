# Accuracy and Stability for Different Weapon Types
Please see the image for credit.

![](acc-stab-tested.jpg)

# Some Builds

* Critical Hit Chance (CHC) has a 60% cap. Switch the excess CHC to Critical Hit
Damage (CHD).
* The stats section in inventory is for weapon #1, swap to see it for the other.
* DTooC = Damage to Targets out of Cover

## Assault Rifle Builds
We need to make CHC high so we can kill things with it.

Specialization is usually Gunner for the ammo replenish.

Some builds use the handgun `Orbit`.

> Swapping from this weapon within 10s of killing an enemy grants 35% critical
> hit chance and 40% critical hit damage for 15s.

Burn down the enemies and then kill them with Orbit. Then you can kill them with
the assault rifle. If doing this, you can reduce your CHC a bit from the cap,
but I prefer to have it high anyways because swapping is not that great.

### Good ARs
Depends on your play style.

----------

## SMG + AR - Hunter's Fury
Similar to the AR builds, increase CHC to the 60% cap (or near cap), then burn
things down.

Specialization: Gunner

Main: SMG - `Dark Winter`. Get in close and spray.

> Perfect Killer:
> Killing an enemy with a critical hit grants +50% critical hit damage for 10
> seconds

2nd Weapon: You can another SMG, I use a `G36 AR with the Ranger talent`. This
is for killing targets further away from cover.

> Amplifies weapon damage by 2% for every 5 meters you are away from your
> target.

Pistol: `Orbit`, doesn't matter tbh.

Head: `Coyote's Mask` God roll with CHC mod.

Backpack: `Liquid Engineer` with armor, health and armor regen. If you feel like
you have enough armor for lower difficulties, switch to the Hunter's Fury
backpack for the 4-piece bonus. Mod: CHC.

The talent is pretty good for the SMG build because you will take a lot of
damage, but if you can keep up the killing tempo especially in Challenging and
below, you will never die.

> Perfect Blood Sucker:
> Killing an enemy adds and refreshes a stack of +12% bonus armor for 10
> seconds, Max stack is 10.

Chest: Red Fenris Group. This gives AR damage. Mod: CHD. Talent is Obliterate.

> Obliterate:
> Critical hits increase total weapon damage by 1% for 5 seconds.
> Stacks up to 25 times.

The talent helps increase damage from critical hits.

Hand, Holster, Knee: Hunter's Fury. Mod the main attribute to be weapon's
damage. If you got one, then mod the 2nd attribute to CHD.

Alternatively, you could swap the backpack to Hunter's Fury to get the 4-piece
bonus.

## Marksman Rifle without Zoom
Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfI-Ic8LD20

The trick with this build is using a marksman rifle with a 4x scope so you're
not zooming. The rifle should have the talent `Determined`:

> After killing an enemy with a headshot the next shot landed on any enemy will
> be a guaranteed headshot.

Ideally, you want the named marksman rifle `The White Death` because of the 137%
bonus to headshot damage (HSD) and reroll the talent to `Determined`.

**Note:** If you swap the weapon, you will lose the `Determined` bonus.

So, after the first headshot, your other body shots will also count as
headshots. One snag is enemies with a helmet. Your hit will destroy the helmet
and you will lose the `Determined` bonus so you have to headshot another enemy.
The bonus is not lost if you use it on drones or mechanical enemies.

This is also coupled with the named chest `Chainkiller` talent that
is `Perfect Headhunter`:

> After killing an enemy with a headshot, your next weapon hit within 30 seconds
> deals an additional 125% of that killing blow's damage.
> 
> Damage is capped to 800% of your weapon damage. This is raised to 1250% if
> your headshot damage is greater than 150%.

You can use the four piece brand `Hotshot` which adds headshot damage on mask,
gloves, holster, and kneepads. Change the secondary talent to HSD. The 4th brand
piece effect is not that important. You can use three of the brand and move
things around. I usually use other things to gain expertise with them.

Backpack is Arialdi holdings with the `Vigilant` talent. Arialdi for the HSD,
but neither the gear brand nor the talent are not that important here.

> Increases total weapon damage by 25%. Taking damage disables this buff for 4
> seconds.

Mods are all HSD.

* Head: Hotshot brand.
    * If using 3 brand pieces: Sometimes I use the `Coyote's Mask` because mine has HSD.
* Chest: `Chainkiller`.
* Holster: Hotshot brand.
    * If using 3 brand pieces: I use `Dodge City Gunslingerâ€™s Holster` for
      instant kill with pistol. If using this, make sure to have a pistol with a
      high damage like `Prophet` pistol because it works with `Chainkiller`.
* Backpack: Arialdi Holdings with Vigilance talent.
    * This is also another place that you can change gear.
* Gloves: Hotshot brand.
* Knees: Hotshot brand.
    * If using 3 brand pieces: You can replace it with `Sawyer's Kneepads`.
* Weapon 1: Marksman rifle with `Determined`, preferably `The White Death`.
* Weapon 2: Not that important. I use a rifle or anything I want to gain expertise in.
* Pistol: `Prophet` is good because it works with `Chainkiller`. But you can
  also use it to gain expertise with items.
* Specialization: Sniper. You will get so many special weapon ammo that you will
  not use.
* Skills: Not that important. I use the armor repair drone on one. The armor
  repair or reviver hive on the other. Sometimes I use the skill I wanna train
  for expertise instead of the hive.

# Weapons
Depends on your play style.

## Rifles
`Baker's Dozen` is a good choice for further enemies as a mini-sniper. Add the
+5 rounds mod for the mag.

`The Virginian` and `Diamondback` are nice, but smaller magazines and slow
reload.

The Diamondback's bonus is great because you can hit the marked enemy
and one-shot the others. Allows you to switch your CHC to CHD.

> Agonising Bite:
> Diamondback randomly marks an enemy. Hitting that enemy
> consumes the mark, guaranteeing a critical hit with damage amplified by 20%.
> After hitting a mark, all shot fired are guaranteed critical hits for 5s. A
> new random enemy is marked afterwards and whenever you reload.

## Snipers
`Mantis` is a great choice with the decoy. Headshot kills refresh the decoy
cool down period.

## Light Machine Guns
These are great if you want to unload a ton of bullets.

`Pestilence` puts a DoT on targets, this jumps to others when they die.

`Sleipnir` is also a good choice.
