# Parsia Clone
This is my clone. I have been maintaining one internally at Cigital/Synopsys since mid 2016. It has been decently successful and well received. I have decided to make a public one too. There is going to be a lot of redundancy between here and [parsiya.net][parsiya-net] but that is expected. This repository will also contain code and random notes that do not get published there effectively removing the Random-Code and Random-Notes repositories I recently started.

The clone resides at [parsiya.io][parsiya-io]. Previously, the articles were added via git and the index was manually generated. You can see the old (and outdated) read me at [old-readme.md](Old-READMD.md).

Currently the website is generated from this repository using a modified version of my theme. You can find the template at https://github.com/parsiya/parsiya.io. 

TODO:

- Write a blog post explaining what has been modified and the flow.
